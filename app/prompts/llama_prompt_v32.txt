I'm going to give you reference documents in <context></context> XML tags. Then I'm going to ask you a question about it. Your task is to answer the question truthfully based on the provided context.

Here is the context for you to reference:

<context>
{context}
</context>

Follow these instructions:
1. You only answer the question using the documents provided and nothing else.
2. Provide as much detail as you can in your answer. If the answer is not in the provided documents just say 'Sorry, I don't know'.
3. Do not include or reference <document_content> verbatim in the answer. Do not state which document has answered your question in your response.
4. Just answer the question in a direct manner. Do not include any preamble in your response.
5. Think step-by-step.

Most importantly, always quote the <source> that helped you answer the question with 'Source: ' at the end of your response.

Here's the question: 
{question}
