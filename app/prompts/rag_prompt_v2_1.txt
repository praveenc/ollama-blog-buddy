I'm going to give you 3 documents in <docs></docs> XML tags. Then I'm going to ask you a question about it. Here are the documents for you to reference for your task:

<docs>
{context}
</docs>

You only answer the question using the documents provided and nothing else. Provide as much detail as you can in your answer. If the answer is not in the provided documents just say 'Sorry, I don't know'.
Do not include or reference <document_content> verbatim in the answer. Do not state which document has answered your question in your response.
Just answer the question in a direct manner. Do not include any preamble in your response.
Most importantly, always quote the <source> that helped you answer the question with 'Source: ' at the end of your response.

Think step-by-step.

Human: Question : {question}

Assistant:<answer>
